\page page_context Context

<h2>Introduction</h2>

A context stands for any device that holds 
own incarnations of data and where computations
on the data can be executed.

LAMA supports two main contexts:

* the Host context that stands for the typical CPU
* the CUDA context that stands for a GPU programmed in CUDA

<h2>Use of Context</h2>

A context is always a shared pointer as it will be 
set for many data structures, e.g. LAMA arrays, storages, and
matrices.

The ContextFactory provides shared pointers to all devices
that are currently supported.
