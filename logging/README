Some coding rules regarding smaller projects.

* All projects should install in the same installation directory

  - INSTALL_PREFIX should be the same for all projects like logging, trace, kernel, ...
 
    <install_prefix>/include/<project-1>/*.hpp
    <install_prefix>/include/<project-2>/*.hpp

    <install_prefix>/lib/<libproject-1>
    <install_prefix>/lib/<libproject-2>

  Advantages:

  - only one include and library path for projects that use multiple smaller projects

  Disadvantages:

  - each subproject needs its own include directory
  - difficult to uninstall a subproject

* All projects should use a common CMake modules directory

  Advantage:

  - same FindBoost, so boost is always used in the same version
  - same handling for all projects

  Disadvantage:

  - not clear which modules are really necessary for which project

* Version handling

   - each subproject gets its own version
   - @since directive should be avoided (difficult to guarantee consistency)

* pragma once

    - simpler, more efficient
    - supported by all relevant compilers
    - avoid file names that might appear in many projects, e.g. config.hpp

* config file for DLL_IMPORT, DLL_EXPORT, or better file for Windows Support

    - only one file for all projects
    - no LAMA naming
    - where to install
