Required Software:

 * C and C++ compiler
 * Boost libraries: thread, program-options
 * BLAS library

Optional Software:

 * MPI (for parallel execution)
 * CUDA (for execution on GPU)
 * CppUnit (for testing)

Useful for tracing:

 * VampirTrace 

CMake modules are provided to find the required and optional software. 
If the software is not installed in default locations you can give hints
where the installation is by setting corresponding environment variables.

Example of setting environment variables for configuration of LAMA with cmake

export BOOST_ROOT=/home/lama/boost_1_46_1/install
export MKL_ROOT=/opt/intel/composerxe-2011.0.084/mkl
export CPPUNIT_ROOT=/home/lama/cppunit-1.12.1/install
export VAMPIRTRACE_ROOT=/home/lama/VampirTrace-5.11.2/install

For using MPI, mpirun should be in your path.

Configuration:

cd <build_dir>
cmake [options] $LAMA/src 

Useful options for LAMA:

 -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Relase
 -D LOG_LEVEL=INFO (or TRACE, DEBUG, ERROR, OFF)
 -D TRACE_LEVEL=VT
 -D ASSERT_LEVEL=DEBUG  (or OFF, ERROR)
 -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/lama/install

Recommended:

cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <lama_src_dir>

After configuration with cmake you have to build it with make. Parallel make is recommended.

    make -j
