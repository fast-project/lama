Project common
--------------

Some basic functionality:

 - Exception (with callstack in message)
 - Assert macros
 - Thread (Thread identifiers, Mutex, Condition, all based on pthread)
 - Printable (base class for objects to be used in streams with <<)
 - Walltime (global wallclock timing)
 - NonCopyable (base class for all classes where to disable default copy constructor)
 - Factory template class

Note:

 - common uses pthread
 - common does NOT use any boost functionality
 - linking with libcommon is required

Examples are provided.
